# Digital Humanities Landscape Switzerland

Digital Humanities Landscape Switzerland (`dh-landscape-ch`) is intended to be an interactive, web-based overview of the Digital Humanities field in Switzerland. It will feature a network-style visualisation of projects, organisations, and researchers, allowing users to explore connections and filter information based on different criteria. The aim is to foster collaboration, provide insights into the Swiss Digital Humanities community.

This is indeed a work in progress. Stay tuned.
